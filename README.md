User interfaces are hard. On the web,
[GreaseMonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) lets us scratch UI itches. While
[Paylocity](http://www.paylocity.com/) is a pretty good
timesheet/payroll/etc. system, it left me with itches to scratch, thus
Better Paylocity. If you already have GreaseMonkey installed then you can
[install Better
Paylocity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anthropohedron/better-paylocity/master/Better_Paylocity.user.js)
now.
